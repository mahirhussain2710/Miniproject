## Diabetes Prediction System
The Diabetes-Prediction project leverages machine learning to analyse routine health parameters (e.g. glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, insulin, age, etc.) and predict the likelihood of diabetes



## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->

This project uses classification algorithms such as Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine to build predictive models.
The goal is to facilitate automated, data-driven risk assessment, helping identify individuals at high risk of diabetes — potentially enabling early diagnosis or preventive measures. 
By applying this ML-based prediction pipeline on clinical or self-reported data, the system demonstrates how data science can contribute to public health, enabling scalable, low-cost screening mechanisms.

## System Architecture
<!--Embed the system architecture diagram as shown below-->

The system follows a modular design with the following components:

Data Input Layer

Accepts health-related attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, and insulin levels.
Data can be sourced from CSV files, databases, or user input through a web interface.

Data Preprocessing Layer

Handles missing values and outliers.
Normalizes and scales features for consistency.
Performs feature selection to improve model efficiency.

 
Model Training Layer

Implements machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN).
Splits data into training and testing sets.
Applies hyperparameter tuning for optimization.
 
Prediction Layer

Uses the trained model to predict whether an individual is diabetic or non-diabetic.
Outputs result with probability scores for better interpretability.

 
User Interface Layer

Provides a web-based or mobile interface using Flask or Stream lit.
Displays prediction results and visualizations (Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve).
